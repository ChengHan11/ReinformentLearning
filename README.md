Example using matlab

Using the matlab GUI, I created a maze environment. And I provided two rl algorithm(MC and DQN) to solve maze problem. Besides, just a little modification, you can test your rl algorithm in maze environment.

The neuro-network of DQN was compiled by myself. Because the neuro-network function of matlab was encountered some problems, when I compiled the DDPG algorithm. Of course, you can use any neuro-network function instead.
